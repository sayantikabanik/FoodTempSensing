# FoodTempSensing
<p>The prototype is a amalgam of software and hardware. It’s been a common scenario that the food is delivered cold at our doorsteps. Still we consumers pay the  complete amount.
My prototype focus  on the displaying of the approx time , under which the food has to be delivered. To detect temperature and for the output display I am using the hardware (Customized shield,by curiosity gym).
The basic principle used behind is “Newton’s Law of Cooling”. 
The room temperature is fixed and the initial temperature of the food is noted.
The final temperature is initialized with the theoretical values obtained.

<h2>Newton’s Law of Cooling-:</h2>
<ul><li>  time=ln((To-Ts)/(Tf-Ts))*k</li>
<li>To- initial temperature (deg C)</li>
<li>Ts- surrounding temperature (deg C)</li>
<li>Tf- final temperature (deg C)</li>
<li>K- constant (dependent on the food parameters)</li></ul> 
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The prototype has immense scope , for detection and alerting both the client and the company about the delivery status. Further the feature can be added into an app for the easy access by the customers. The company can also have a tracking feature , in order to eradicate the fake pings of late delivery by the customer.
